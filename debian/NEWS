salt (0.15.1-1) unstable; urgency=high

    A security issue has been identified with all keys generated in
    versions prior to 0.15.1. This issue has been fixed in this
    version.

    To fix, or rather replace, existing security keys, users will
    need to execute a new runner on their Salt Master:

      salt-run manage.key_regen

    Then restart the master. Each minion will attempt to
    reauthenticate and will need to have it's key re-added via:

      salt-key -A

salt (0.11.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  The default location for pki_dir, chachedir and sock_dir has changed
  and includes now the service as the last part of the directory, i.e.
  pki_dir has changed from /etc/salt/pki/ to /etc/salt/pki/master for the
  master and /etc/salt/pki/minion/ for the minion.

  The integrated migration from salt should move the necessary files
  automatically.
