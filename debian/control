Description: shared libraries that salt requires for all packages
 salt is a powerful remote execution manager that can be used to
 administer servers in a fast and efficient way.
 .
 It allows commands to be executed across large groups of
 servers. This means systems can be easily managed, but data can
 also be easily gathered.  Quick introspection into running
 systems becomes a reality.
 .
 Remote execution is usually used to set up a certain state on a
 remote system. Salt addresses this problem as well, the salt
 state system uses salt state files to define the state a server
 needs to be in.
 .
 Between the remote execution system, and state management Salt
 addresses the backbone of cloud and data center management.
 .
 This particular package provides shared libraries that
 salt-master, salt-minion, and salt-syndic require to function.

Description: Generic, modular network access system
 a modular interface on top of Salt that can provide a variety of entry points
 into a running Salt system. It can start and manage multiple interfaces
 allowing a REST API to coexist with XMLRPC or even a Websocket API.
 .
 The Salt API system is used to expose the fundamental aspects of Salt control
 to external sources. salt-api acts as the bridge between Salt itself and
 REST, Websockets, etc.
